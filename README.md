# BibTeX Parser Experiments

Experiments to determine the new BibTeX parser formula. The result may be applied
to other formats as well in the future.

![Parsing stages of BibTeX](stages.png)

Above is some pseudo-grammar describing the stages of parsing. The reason I
distinguish between parsing the file and parsing values is best demonstrated in
the "entry value with mid-command concatenation" test case:

Input:
```bibtex
@book{a,
  title = "foo \\copy" # "right{} bar"
}
```

Output:
```js
[{
  type: 'book',
  id: 'a',
  properties: {
    title: 'foo © bar'
  }
}]
```

## Participants

Note: `idea` (Citation.js Idea #1) and `nearley` are skipped in some tables, as
they are only in here for historic reasons.

### Citation.js (old) → "current"

At the time of starting these experiments, the `TokenStack` class was utilized,
together with a simple RegExp that tokenizes commands.

### Citation.js Ideas

The idea was to explore tokenization without introducing a formal grammar, as
formal grammars introduce extra build steps, runtime dependencies and large swaths
of generated code. However, used as I was to the syntax of `PEG.js` and `nearley.js`,
I made some unnecessarily complicated features like `consumeAnyRule()`, and some
weird loops in the rules. This was partly due to bad tokenization.

Idea #2 ("idea-reworked") has new tokens, a simpler `Grammar` class and simplified
rules. It also has more features, including more commands and diacritics, including
more ways to write them.

### Citation.js with nearley

In parallel to reworking the idea, I used the tokenizer in a `nearley.js` grammar,
which failed miserably. This is probably the result of bad grammar-writing on my
part, and not a reflection of the capabilities of `nearley.js`. However, an additional
downside of this route is that it introduces an extra build step (`nearleyc`) and
a runtime dependency — `nearley` itself.

### astrocite

The `astrocite-bibtex` package by @dsifford uses PEG.js. It is capable of returning
an AST.

### fiduswriter

Fiduswriter's `biblatex-csl-converter` seems to perform very poorly on the larger
file. However, it does return lossless values, although I am not a fan of the
(lack of) difference between arrays representing single and multiple values:

```js
[
  { type: 'text', text: 'foo' }
]
// vs
[
  { literal: [{ type: 'text', text: 'foo' }] },
  { literal: [{ type: 'text', text: 'bar' }] }
]
```

This causes testing such as

```js
literal in value[0]
// or more properly
value.every(part => literal in part)
```

### Zotero

Zotero Translators are relatively hard to use stand-alone, as they depend on a
Zotero framework in the global scope. It immediately converts to Zotero API JSON
while parsing the syntax. Not shown in the performance table is that Zotero
requires initialization, not counting the time it takes to import files, and that
this takes relatively long.

### Better BibTeX for Zotero (BBT)

Using `@retorquere/bibtex-parser`, this performs very well. It is capable of
returning an AST. I have not had a chance to test out all the parser features
for literal/text/name values yet.

### JabRef

JabRef is reference management software with Bib(La)TeX as the internal
representation, so one can assume their support for parsing it to be pretty good.
However, I have not found a way to export their internal representation in the
level of detail required for passing the syntax tests. Similarly, as their program
only partly supports a CLI (no stdio) and is written in Java, a performance
comparison would not be very fair. For now, it is possible to test syntax features
by uncommenting the `jabref` entry in `test/feature.js` and running
`npm run features -- parser jabref`.

  syntax (commands, formatting), and disregarding AST

## Syntax Features

Empty cells indicate a choice to follow either natbib or biblatex for
certain behavior, this becomes clear from context. If both cells are
empty, this is may be an error, but that should be indicated by a
different test fixture. Auto-generated by `npm run features -- fixtures`,
see also [the fixture file](test/fixtures/features.js).
